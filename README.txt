This is a program to generate a webpage from all PRO song files.

* All song files have to be in the /songs folder, with `.pro` file extension.
* run `python generate.py` from this directory to re-generate `index.html` from the song files.
* open the updated index.html to test.
* after it's checked, move this index.html to the /final-web-site folder. 
* the files at the web host should be updated accordingly. Only files under /final-web-site are needed.
