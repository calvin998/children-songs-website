[D]Brothers speaking [Bm]grouchily,
[G]Hatefully and [A]angrily,
[D]That kind of [Bm]family
[G]Has such [A]hostility!
[D]Watch or e[Bm]ventually
[G]There'll be bru[A]tality â€“
[D]Stop, oh stop, oh [Bm]stop that talk!
[G]Where your words go,
[A]You will walk!
[D]Hear this [Bm]dream,
[G]Which Joseph [A]dreamed of you —
[D]Sheaves and [Bm]stars,
[G]Even the [A]sun and moon,
[D]Bowing [Bm]down,
[G]Oh, what a [A]dream God [D]gave!
He [Bm]sees you [G]bright and shining, [A]full of life[D]!
